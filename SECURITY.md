## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing code:

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables
   - Check .gitignore
   - Use .env.example templates

2. **Validate all inputs**
   - Use Pydantic models (backend)
   - Use Zod schemas (frontend)
   - Sanitize user input

3. **Use parameterized queries**
   - Never concatenate SQL queries
   - Use ORM features properly

4. **Implement proper authentication**
   - Use JWT tokens correctly
   - Implement proper session management
   - Check authorization on all protected routes

5. **Handle errors securely**
   - Don't expose stack traces to users
   - Log errors securely
   - Use generic error messages

6. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update packages
   - Check for known vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit`

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords**
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** (when available)
3. **Keep your account information private**
4. **Log out from shared computers**
5. **Report suspicious activity**

## 🔐 Security Features

### Current Implementation

- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 12)
- ✅ Rate limiting (Redis-backed)
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Input validation (Pydantic + Zod)
- ✅ SQL injection protection (ORM)
- ✅ XSS protection (React auto-escaping)
- ✅ HTTPS in production
- ✅ Secure environment variable handling
- ✅ Error monitoring (Sentry)

### Planned Improvements

- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Account recovery
- [ ] Session management improvements
- [ ] Enhanced rate limiting
- [ ] Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Regular security audits

## 📋 Security Checklist (For Reviewers)
